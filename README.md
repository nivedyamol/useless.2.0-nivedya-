### Project Description
This interactive rice counter project creatively blends fun and awareness. Users enter their name to discover how many grains of rice they are destined to ‚Äòeat‚Äô, displayed with a lively falling rice animation and an engaging counter. It‚Äôs designed to entertain and at the same time useless.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
‡¥ì‡¥∞‡µã ‡¥Ö‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µÅ‡¥Ç ‡¥Ö‡¥§‡µÅ ‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡µá‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü ‡¥Ü‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥±‡µÜ ‡¥™‡µá‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡µç" ‚Äî ‚ÄúEvery grain of rice has the name of the person meant to eat it.‚Äù This old saying reflects the belief that food is destined for someone specific. While it‚Äôs just a cultural expression and not a real scientific fact, some people doubt or poke fun at it. This project turns that saying into a playful experience by letting users ‚Äòfind out‚Äô how many grains of rice have their name on them.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Instead of arguing about whether rice grains have names on them, we built a highly advanced, 100% scientifically inaccurate software to settle the matter once and for all. Just type your name, and we‚Äôll use our super-secret rice-counting algorithm‚Ñ¢ to tell you exactly how many grains of rice are yours ‚Äî complete with a falling rice animation to make it look extra official. Problem solved. You‚Äôre welcome.

For Software:

This project is a fun and quirky web-based application inspired by the Malayalam saying:

"‡¥ì‡¥∞‡µã ‡¥Ö‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡¥ø‡¥≤‡µÅ‡¥Ç ‡¥Ö‡¥§‡µÅ ‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡µá‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü ‡¥Ü‡¥≥‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥±‡µÜ ‡¥™‡µá‡¥∞‡µÅ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡µç"
("Every grain of rice has the name of the person who will eat it.")

The application:

Shows a visually appealing introduction page with cultural imagery.

Lets the user enter their name to ‚Äúfind out‚Äù how many rice grains they can eat.

Uses a JavaScript-powered counter to generate a random number (customizable) and display it with a falling rice animation for dramatic effect.

Is fully front-end (no server needed) and can run directly in any modern browser.
